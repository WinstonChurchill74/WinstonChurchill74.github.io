<p>Winston Churchill attended various private schools starting with St. George's Ascot at the age of 7 and ending with Harrow. Winston shined in sports, history and writing. He was obsessed with anything military and got into Sandhurst Royal Military College and became a calvary cadet. After graduating from Sandhurst, he joined the Fourth Hussars, a calvary regiment in the British army.</p>

<p>After observing the war and Cuba and fighting in India, Churchill was deployed into South Africa to report the Boer War for the Morning Post. Churchill was captured by the opposition and held prisoner. He escaped, returned to England as a war hero, and wrote two books on the war.</p>
